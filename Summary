# Employees-Management-System
# Me and my friend have an idea about a project built on my previous JAVA assignment. 
# My JAVA assignment required student to write a program to manage a company's  staff.
The program have 8 main function:
  1. Display the list of existing employees of the company
  2. Show departments in the company
  3. Display employees by department
  4. Add new employees to the company
  5. Search for employee information by their Name or ID
  6. Display payroll of employees throughout the company
  7. Display employee payroll in ascending order
  8. Display employee payroll in descending order
# So using our knowledge in Java and also mySQL we connect the program and the database together.
# In order to review the process we received from SWedu program last summer after the long time gain more knowledge and simulate how the real system actully work
